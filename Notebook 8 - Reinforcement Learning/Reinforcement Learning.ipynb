The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so you must navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the direction you intend.\n","The goal of this game is to go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G) by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoid holes (H). However, the ice is slippery (!!), so you won't always move in the direction you intend (stochastic environment), i.e., there is a probability $p$ that you move in the direction selected and a probability $(1-p)$ that given the slippery ice, you move to a random position near position. Specifically, let's say you select the action UP, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going UP, 1/3 of going RIGHT and 1/3 of going LEFT. Similarly, if you select LEFT, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going LEFT, 1/3 of going UP and 1/3 of going DOWN.\n","\n","The lake is represented by a 4x4 grid and the location where the frisbee has landed (G) as well as the holes (H) is always the same for every new game. The game is restarted every time you have successfully recovered the frisbee or you have fallen into the cold waters. A reward of +1 is given every time you recover the frisbee and 0 other way.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nNrutC72jZRZ"},"source":["**Step 0: Import the needed libraries:**\n","\n","We will be using 3 libraries:\n","\n","* Numpy for our Qtable.\n","* OpenAI Gym for our FrozenLake Environment\n","* Random to generate random numbers\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Q0OxrnpgjyFh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617018138030,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1829,"user":{"displayName":"Udai Arneja","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgvIZT5RqqegbdTKMziVehjeBTFwnu84VVrx1gbS5A=s64","userId":"09880777762577870649"}}},"source":["from IPython.display import HTML\n","import numpy as np\n","import gym\n","import random"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p-Nx8PYnj4I5"},"source":["**Environment creation:**\n","\n","OpenAi is  a library composed of many environments that we can use to train our agents, in our case we choose to use the Frozen Lake."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DWgurerLkNLe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617018139609,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1501,"user":{"displayName":"Udai Arneja","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgvIZT5RqqegbdTKMziVehjeBTFwnu84VVrx1gbS5A=s64","userId":"09880777762577870649"}}},"source":["env = gym.make(\"FrozenLake-v0\")"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BeaPjILgkS7Z"},"source":["**Q-table**\n","\n"," Now, we'll create our Q-table.

Coursework\n","\n","## Task 1: On-policy vs. Off-policy\n","Use the code given below to run the training loop, where the agent is trained for 200 episodes. The agent we give follows a Q-learning approach, which is an off-policy approach. You will now change the approach to SARSA, which is an on-policy approach. Also, for both Q-learning and SARSA test two different policies: $\\epsilon$-greedy and Softmax. $\\epsilon$-greedy is already defined in the tutorial and implemented in the given agent. Softmax policy refers to sampling the next action following the probability distribution given by $Softmax(Q(s, a))$. We provide you the NumPy softmax function to normalize the Q-Values into a probability function to use before sampling. Similarly to RNN, in the softmax function, there is a temperature value involved, we set a default value that works, but you can tweak it if you find another value with better performance. Report the new value if you decide to do so.\n","\n","You will need to modify `act` and `replay` from the `DQNAgent` to implement the different approaches we ask for. Results may differ from run to run due to different initialization states. \n","\n","**Report**\n","* Plot the average reward for the last 50 episodes vs. number of training episodes (train for 200 episodes) for the four agents trained: Q-learning and SARSA with both $\\epsilon$-greedy policy and Softmax policy. Attach in the Appendix the modifications done to `DQNAgent` to implement the different agents.
